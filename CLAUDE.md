# Apex Pool Enclosures - Claude Code Context

## Project Overview
Acoustic enclosures for pool heaters/chillers - soundproofing with ventilation.

## Parent Brand
**Apex Enclosures** - same brand as TV enclosures project

## Key Requirements
- **Soundproofing:** Reduce heater/chiller noise for villa environments
- **Ventilation:** Must allow airflow for equipment cooling (unlike pump enclosures)
- **Weatherproof:** Outdoor installation, Gulf climate (IP65/66)
- **Heat dissipation:** Heaters and chillers generate significant heat

## User Context
- User has semi-sunken pump enclosure (already noise-free)
- Heater/chiller is the noise source that needs addressing
- Same manufacturing partners as TV enclosure project (Al Shurooq, etc.)

## Research Areas
1. Pool heater/chiller noise levels and frequencies
2. Acoustic enclosure designs with ventilation
3. Competitor products in UAE/Gulf market
4. Ventilation requirements for heat pump equipment
5. Acoustic materials compatible with outdoor use
